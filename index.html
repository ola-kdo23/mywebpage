                <p>"Hey there, I'm Ola a computer science student, passionate about problem-solving, sustainable energy research and
                    positive technological advancements that could reshape our world for the better.
                    
                    Currently in my fourth year, I have been exposed to efficient and dynamic methods of programming, how to incorporate
                    research strategies to tackle complicated problems, developing leadership skills and good collaborative abilities, and 
                    how to navigate the evolving world of Artificial Intelligence- specifically how to apply and advance it responsibly.
                    
                    I'm excited for the opportunity to apply these skills and make a real impact in the ever-changing world of computer science.
                    No one ever said it'd be easy, but I am here for the challenge"
